1. Implement other scaling methods
2. Check that capture resolution is within screen size
    2a. Change to captureResolution + screenRegion instead of captureRes and destRes
3. Implement scaling within Capture.h (user should never interface with Scale.h)
4. Improve performance (currently, many uneccesary copies)
